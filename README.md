ForkStalkSharp
==============

Just some stalking project.

It takes a repository owner and name and returns information about updated forks.

Useful for tracking forks which have contributions.

TODO:
 * [ ] Track and return more information than just fork name and branch.
 * [ ] Find a way to use less API calls. Rate limiting can hurt.
